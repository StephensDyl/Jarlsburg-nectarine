This is a testing repository, I don't think anyone will read this.

apparently I was incorrect seeing as I am submitting this readme file for an assignment. I am currently writing a paragraph for that very assignment wherein I am required to write a paragraph contained within a readme file inside a public directory. Insofar as I need to write a few more sentences I will articulate my potential nomenclature system for my repositories. By using a combination of a cheese and a fruit I will keep them fresh and memorable plus its fairly easy to alphabetize them if so needed
